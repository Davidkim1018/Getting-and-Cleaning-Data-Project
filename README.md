##My Work Process
  
1. Download and unzip the dataset
2. Read activity labels
3. Read features
4. Extract only mean and std
5. Load train dataset and bind
6. Load test dataset and bind
7. merge train and test dataset, and rename column_name
8. turn activity & subject into factors
9. Use melt and dcast function
10. Write the data

##Original Instruction
###The Work: 
 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

###Reiview Criteria : 
 1. The submitted data set is tidy.
 2. The Github repo contains the required scripts.
 3. GitHub contains a code book that modifies and updates the available codebooks with the data to indicate all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information.
 4. The README that explains the analysis files is clear and understandable.
 5. The work submitted for this project is the work of the student who submitted it.

###Dataset Information
1. A group of 30 volunteers 
2. 19~48 years old
3. Each person performed six activities ( WALKING, WALKING_UPSTARIS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone(Samsung Galaxy S 2) on the waist. 
4. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. 
5. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.
